Conventions:
there are 4 rings that can be turned, 16 positions per ring. Thus there are 16^4 combinations = 65,535 possible combinations

there are some interdependencies between rings which have to be coded. But each ring can only be in 1 of 16 positions

There are thus 16 wedges, and the puzzle is to find the exact ring positions where all wedges independently sum to 50.
